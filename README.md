# OOPTermProject
This repository contains the term project that I did for Object-Oriented Programming course in 2nd year of university.

The aim of the game is to get as many “gems” as one can before the enemies steal them 
and to reach the “treasure” successfully, without falling into traps or being caught by enemies.

Controls: w - up, s - down, a - left, d - right.

Instructions:
- You are the player, P.
- If you step on trap T - you lose.
- Es are enemies - don't get caught!
- Collect gems that look like * before enemies steal them. 
  More gems means more points!
- To win - reach treasure marked by X.
